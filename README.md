# Japanese-Art-Game
This game is using the Phaser framework.........

This is my first repository and I wanted to get some help on a game I am working on. 
It's a flappy bird clone and the prototype is done, but the main part I need help with is the art side of the game (the background mainly). 
I need help making the art of the game Ukiyo-e style which is a Japanese art style, 
kind of like a game called Okami, but not as intense and more in a simple mobile style. 
I can envision the game in my head, but it’s really hard to make it real because I am limited in my art skills. 
Hopefully the prototype will give you an idea how it’s supposed to look. The game right now is not perfect, it’s a prototype.
